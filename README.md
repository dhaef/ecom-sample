## Ecommerce Example Site

This project is a fun practice react app where I recreate an online clothing shop and add common features seen on the web. This was my first project using react on my own with the use of tutorials.

Some key features include filtering products with a form, selecting size and quanitiy of items and adding the selected item to the cart, deleting from the cart, and not allowing duplicate fields in the cart/checking for item being in stock or having desired amount in stock.

A few improvements could be styling the product card elements, styling the cart items, and allowing the customer to edit item in the cart.

This project can be found [here](https://dhaef-react-ecom.herokuapp.com/). This will take a few seconds as it is hosted for free on heroku so the app must build.

## How to download

To download just clone the repo and init the project with npm to download the dependencies.
